# Heading Level 1

Italicized text is the *cat's meow*.

## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

### Heading level 3

Try to put a blank line before...

#### Heading level 4

...and after a heading.

##### Heading level 5

<p>I really like using Markdown.</p>

<p>I think I'll use it to format all of my documents from now on.</p>

###### Line Breaks

To create a line break or new line (<br>), end a line with two or more spaces, and then type return.

<p>This is the first line.<br> And this is the second line.</p>

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

## Lists

To create an unordered list, add dashes (-), asterisks (\*), or plus signs (+) in front of line items. Indent one or more items to create a nested list.

-   First item
-   Second item
-   Third item
-   Fourth item

## To render as pdf

You want to do "quarto install tinytex" in the R Terminal.
